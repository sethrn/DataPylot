Importing a dataset is the entry point for a machine learning workflow.

The Pandas library defines the DataFrame object, which is used to hold a 
structured dataset and perform common operations on it.

To load a dataset stored as a file on your computer into a DataFrame within
your python environment, Pandas contains functions that take the filepath, 
relative to the current working directory, or the absolute filepath
(which DataPylot uses).

To view a DataFrame in a formatted way, the head(n) function is used to 
display the first n rows, with a default value of 5 rows.
